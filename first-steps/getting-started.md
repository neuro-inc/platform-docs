# Getting Started

## Introduction

There are two things you will need to do before you start working with Apolo:

1. [Install the CLI client](../documentation/english/cli/installing.md).
2. [Understand the platform's main concepts](getting-started.md#understanding-the-main-concepts).

After this, you're free to explore the platform and it's functionality. As a good starting point, we've included a section about [development on GPU with Jupyter Notebooks](getting-started.md#developing-on-gpu-with-jupyter-notebooks).

## Understanding the main concepts

On the **Apolo** level, you will work with jobs, environments, and storage. To be more specific, a job (an execution unit) runs in a given environment (Docker container) on a given preset (a combination of CPU, GPU, and memory resources allocated for this job) with several storage instances (block or object storage) attached.

Here are some examples.

### Hello, World!

Run a job on CPU which prints “Hello, World!” and shuts down:

```
$ apolo run --preset cpu-small --name test ubuntu -- echo Hello, World!
```

Executing this command will result in an output like this:

```
√ Job ID: job-7dd12c3c-ae8d-4492-bdb9-99509fda4f8c
√ Name: test
- Status: pending Creating
- Status: pending Scheduling
- Status: pending ContainerCreating
√ Http URL: https://test--jane-doe.jobs.default.org.neu.ro
√ The job will die in a day. See --life-span option documentation for details.
√ Status: succeeded
√ =========== Job is running in terminal mode ===========
√ (If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter)
√ (Use Ctrl-P Ctrl-Q key sequence to detach from the job)
Hello, World!
```

### A simple GPU job

Run a job on GPU in the default Apolo environment (`ghcr.io/neuro-inc/base`) that checks if CUDA is available in this environment:

```
$ apolo run --preset gpu-small --name test  ghcr.io/neuro-inc/base -- python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available());"
```

We used the `gpu-small` preset for this job. To see the full list of presets you can use, run the following command:

```
$ apolo config show
```

### Working with platform storage

Create a new `demo` directory in the root directory of your platform storage:

```
$ apolo mkdir -p storage:demo
```

Run a job that mounts the `demo` directory from platform storage to the `/demo` directory in the job container and creates a file in it:

```
$ apolo run --volume storage:demo:/demo:rw ubuntu -- bash -c "echo Hello >> /demo/hello.txt"
```

Check that the file you have just created is actually on the storage:

```
$ apolo ls storage:demo
```

## Developing on GPU with Jupyter Notebooks

Development in Jupyter Notebooks is a good example of how the Apolo Platform can be used. While you can run a Jupyter Notebooks session in one command through CLI or in one click in the Console, we recommend project-based development. To simplify the process, we provide a project template which is based on the [**cookiecutter** package](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter). This template provides the basic necessary folder structure and integrations with several recommended tools.

### Initializing a Apolo cookiecutter flow

First, you will need to install the **cookiecutter** package via **pip** or **pipx**:

```
$ pipx install cookiecutter
```

Now, to initialize a new Apolo flow using [cookiecutter](https://github.com/neuro-inc/cookiecutter-neuro-project/blob/master/cookiecutter.json) template, run:

```
$ cookiecutter gh:neuro-inc/cookiecutter-neuro-project --checkout release
```

This command will prompt you to enter some info about your new flow:

```
project_name [Neuro Project]: New Cookiecutter Project
project_dir [new cookiecutter project]:
project_id [new_cookiecutter_project]:
code_directory [modules]:
preserve Neuro Flow template hints [yes]:
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Default values are indicated by square brackets **\[ ].** You can use them by pressing **Enter**.
{% endhint %}

To navigate to the flow directory, run:

```
$ cd new-cookiecutter-project
```

### Flow structure

The structure of the project's folder will look like this:

```
new-cookiecutter-project
├── .github/            <- Github workflows and a dependabot.yml file
├── .neuro/             <- apolo and apolo-flow CLI configuration files
├── config/             <- configuration files for various integrations
├── data/               <- training and testing datasets (we don't keep it under source control)
├── notebooks/          <- Jupyter notebooks
├── modules/            <- models' source code
├── results/            <- training artifacts
├── .gitignore          <- default .gitignore file for a Python ML project
├── .neuro.toml         <- autogenerated config file for Apolo CLI
├── .neuroignore        <- a file telling Apolo CLI which files to ignore while uploading to the platform storage
├── HELP.md             <- autogenerated template reference
├── README.md           <- autogenerated informational file
├── Dockerfile          <- description of the docker image used for training in your flow
├── apt.txt             <- list of system packages to be installed in the training environment
├── requirements.txt    <- list of Python dependencies to be installed in the training environment
├── setup.cfg           <- linter settings (Python code quality checking)
└── update_actions.py   <- script used to update apolo-flow actions in one of the GitHub workflows
```

The template contains the `.neuro/live.yaml` configuration file for `apolo-flow`. This file guarantees a proper connection between the flow structure, the base environment that we provide, and actions with storage and jobs. For example, the `upload` command synchronizes sub-folders on your local machine with sub-folders on the persistent platform storage, and those sub-folders are synchronized with the corresponding sub-folders in job containers.

### Setting up the environment and running Jupyter

To set up the project environment, run:

```
$ apolo-flow build train
$ apolo-flow mkvolumes
```

When these commands are executed, system packages from `apt.txt` and pip dependencies from `requirements.txt` are installed to the base environment. It supports CUDA by default and contains the most popular ML/AI frameworks such as Tensorflow and Pytorch.

For Jupyter Notebooks to run properly, the `train.py` script and the notebook itself should be available on the storage. Upload the `code` directory containing this file to the storage by using the following command:

```
$ apolo-flow upload ALL
```

Now you need to choose a preset on which you want to run your Jupyter jobs. To view the list of presets available on the current cluster, run:

```
$ apolo config show 
```

To start a Jupyter Notebooks session run:

```
$ apolo-flow run jupyter
```

This command will open Jupyter Notebooks interface in your default browser.

{% hint style="info" %}
Also, you can adjust the _jupyter_ job's preset configuration by specifying the _**preset**_ argument to reflect your preferred preset:

```
jupyter:
    action: gh:neuro-actions/jupyter@<version>
    args:
      ...
      preset: <gpu-preset-name>
      ...
```

After this, each time you run a Jupyter job, it will use the specified by default without the need for you to provide it in a CLI command:

```
$ apolo-flow run jupyter 
```

[You can find more information about job description arguments here](https://github.com/neuro-actions/jupyter#arguments)
{% endhint %}

Now, when you edit notebooks, they are updated on your platform storage. To download them locally (for example, to save them under a version control system), run:

```
$ apolo-flow download notebooks
```

Don’t forget to terminate your job when you no longer need it (the files won’t disappear after that):

```
$ apolo-flow kill jupyter
```

To check how many credits you have left, run:

```
$ apolo config show
```
