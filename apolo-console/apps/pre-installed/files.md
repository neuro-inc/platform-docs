# Files

## Overview

The Files application is a comprehensive file management system designed to help you organize and manage your network storage within the cluster. This documentation will guide you through its features and functionality using Apolo Console.

### **Storage Organization**

Your organization receives a storage space within the cluster, structured in a hierarchical manner:

* Organization Level: The root folder for all your organization's files
* Project Level: Individual project folders within your organization
* Custom Folders: User-created folders for further organization
