# Organizations

## Start with organization

Organizations are formed as a collections of users that have common access to some subset of clusters and could share credits.

After account creating you have two options:
- create your own organization;
- send your user name for adding to the existed organization.

By inviting other users into organizations, those users automatically obtain access to all clusters organization was added to. 

When users run their apps within organization, they consume this organization credits which enables teams to have shared balance. 

Team members could also top-up organization balance in Apolo web app by clicking on the Credits menu.
