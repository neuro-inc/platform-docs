# Disks

As opposed to standard platform storage, disks provide a faster, short-lived, non-partitioned space for jobs. This makes disks perfect for manipulating large amounts of data.&#x20;

For example, if there's a large dataset that you need to process, it's better to create a disk, upload all of the required data from the storage to this disk, and only then perform all the necessary operations. In some cases, this can save you about 10%-20% of time depending on the amount of data and the operations you perform with it. After the data is processed, you can download it back to the storage for further use.

### Creating disks

The `apolo disk create` command is used to create disks. When creating a disk, you need to specify its storage capacity by providing a corresponding value as a parameter. You can also specify the disk's name, which provides a more convenient way of accessing it in commands later. For example:

```
> apolo disk create --name test-disk 40G
```

This will create with a storage capacity of `40 * 2^30` bytes and a name of `test-disk`. Note that some servers can have a predefined granularity (for example, 1GB), so the values you provide will be rounded up in such cases.

### Disk lifespan

Disks have a limited lifetime. This lifespan is calculated from the point in time the disk was last used. The default lifespan of a disk is 1 day. You can also specify a custom lifespan by providing the corresponding value in a `--timeout-unused` parameter when creating a disk:&#x20;

```
> apolo disk create --name test-disk --timeout-unused 2d4h 40G
  Id              disk-6d1c44dc-d759-4bc8-8eb2-feafea463898
  Storage         2.0G
  Used
  Uri             disk://default/jane-doe/disk-6d1c44dc-d759-4bc8-8eb2-feafea463898
  Name            test-disk
  Status          Pending
  Created at      a second from now
  Last used
  Timeout unused  2d 4h
```

This will set the disk's lifespan to 2 days and 4 hours after last usage.

You can find more information about using the `apolo disk create` command, see [create](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MOkWy7dB5MDbkSII8iF/commands/disk#create "mention").

### Mounting disks

You can use disks when running jobs. The process is very similar to [mounting storage](storage.md#how-do-i-use-storage-folders-in-jobs).&#x20;

To mount a disk to a job's container, use the `--volume` parameter in the `run` command. The syntax for this is `--volume disk:<disk-id-or-name>:/mnt/disk`. You need to replace `<disk-id-or-name>` with the disk's actual ID or name. You could also adjust `/mnt/disk/` part, which defines the path within the running job, where the disk will be mounted. The disk's ID and name are shown when the disk is created.

{% hint style="info" %}
You cannot mount a subpath from the disk into the job (as opposed to the`storage:`). Namely, the following syntax is invalid: `--volume disk:<disk-id-or-name>/disk/path:/job/path`
{% endhint %}

Here's an example:

```bash
apolo run --volume disk:test-disk:/mnt/test-disk ubuntu -- echo "Hi" > /mnt/test-disk/echo-file
```
