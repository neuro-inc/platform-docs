# Training Your First Model

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we describe the recommended way to train a simple machine learning model on the Apolo platform. As our ML engineers prefer PyTorch over other ML frameworks, we show the training and evaluation of one of the basic PyTorch examples.

We assume that you have already signed up to the platform, installed the Apolo CLI, and logged in to the platform (see [Getting Started](getting-started.md)).

We base our example on the [Classifying Names with a Character-Level RNN](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char\_rnn\_classification\_tutorial.html) tutorial.

## Initializing a new flow

To simplify working with Apolo Platform and to help establish the best practices in the ML environment, we provide a [flow template](https://github.com/neuro-inc/cookiecutter-neuro-project). This template consists of the recommended directories and files. It's designed to operate smoothly with our [base environment](https://hub.docker.com/r/neuromation/base).

To use it, install the [**cookiecutter**](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) package and initialize **cookiecutter-neuro-project**:

```
$ pipx install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter gh:neuro-inc/cookiecutter-neuro-project --checkout release
```

You will then need to provide some information about the new project:

```
project_name [Name of the project]: Apolo Tutorial
project_dir [neuro-tutorial]:
project_id [neuro-tutorial]:
code_directory [modules]: rnn
preserve Neuro Flow template hints [yes]:
```

## Flow configuration structure

After you execute the command mentioned above, you get the following structure:

```
apolo-tutorial
├── .github/            <- Github workflows and a dependabot.yml file
├── .neuro/             <- apolo and apolo-flow CLI configuration files
├── config/             <- configuration files for various integrations
├── data/               <- training and testing datasets (we don't keep it under source control)
├── notebooks/          <- Jupyter notebooks
├── rnn/                <- models' source code
├── results/            <- training artifacts
├── .gitignore          <- default .gitignore file for a Python ML project
├── .neuro.toml         <- autogenerated config file
├── .neuroignore        <- a file telling apolo to ignore the results/ folder
├── HELP.md             <- autogenerated template reference
├── README.md           <- autogenerated informational file
├── Dockerfile          <- description of the base image used for your project
├── apt.txt             <- list of system packages to be installed in the training environment
├── requirements.txt    <- list of Python dependencies to be installed in the training environment
├── setup.cfg           <- linter settings (Python code quality checking)
└── update_actions.py   <- instructions on update actions
```

When you run a job (for example, via `apolo-flow run jupyter`), the directories are mounted to the job as follows:

| Mount Point           | Description              | Storage URI                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `/project/data/`      | Training / testing data  | `storage:neuro-tutorial/data/`      |
| `/project/rnn/`       | User's Python code       | `storage:neuro-tutorial/rnn/`       |
| `/project/notebooks/` | User's Jupyter notebooks | `storage:neuro-tutorial/notebooks/` |
| `/project/results/`   | Logs and results         | `storage:neuro-tutorial/results/`   |

## Filling the flow

Now we need to fill newly created flow with the content:

* Change working directory:

```
$ cd apolo-tutorial
```

* Copy the [model source](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/master/intermediate\_source/char\_rnn\_classification\_tutorial.py) to your `rnn` folder:

```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/tutorials/master/intermediate_source/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.py -o rnn/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.py
```

* Download data from [here](https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/data.zip), extract the ZIP’s content and put it in your `data` folder:

```
$ curl https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/data.zip -o data/data.zip && unzip data/data.zip && rm data/data.zip
```

## Training and evaluating the model

When you start working with a flow on the Apolo platform, the basic flow looks as follows: you set up the remote environment, upload data and code to your storage, run training, and evaluate the results.

To set up the remote environment, run

```
$ apolo-flow build train
```

This command will run a lightweight job (via `apolo run`), upload the files containing your dependencies `apt.txt` and `requirements.txt` (via `apolo cp`), install the dependencies (using `apolo exec`), do other preparatory steps, and then create the base image from this job and push it to the platform (via `apolo save`, which works similarly to `docker commit`).

To upload data and code to your storage, run

```
$ apolo-flow upload ALL
```

To run training job, you need to specify the training script in `.neuro/live.yaml`, and then run `apolo-flow run train`:

* open `.neuro/live.yaml` in an editor,
* find the following lines (make sure you're looking at the `train` job, not `multitrain` which has a very similar section):

```
    bash: |
        cd $[[ volumes.project.mount ]]
        python -u $[[ volumes.code.mount ]]/train.py --data $[[ volumes.data.mount ]]
```

* and replace it with the following lines:&#x20;

```
    bash: |
        cd $[[ volumes.project.mount ]]
        python -u $[[ volumes.code.mount ]]/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.py
```

Now, you can run

```
$ apolo-flow run train
```

and observe the output. You will see how some checks are made at the beginning of the script, and then the model is being trained and evaluated:

```
