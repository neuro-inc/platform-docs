### cp

Copy files and directories

#### Usage

```bash
neuro storage cp [OPTIONS] [SOURCES]... [DESTINATION]
```

Copy files and directories.

Either `SOURCES` or `DESTINATION` should have storage:// scheme. If scheme is omitted, file:// scheme is assumed.

Use /dev/stdin and /dev/stdout file names to copy a file from terminal and print the content of file on the storage to console.

#### Examples

```bash
# copy local files into remote storage root
$ neuro cp foo.txt bar/baz.dat storage:
$ neuro cp foo.txt bar/baz.dat -t storage:

# copy local directory `foo` into existing remote directory `bar`
$ neuro cp -r foo -t storage:bar

# copy the content of local directory `foo` into existing remote
# directory `bar`
$ neuro cp -r -T storage:foo storage:bar

# download remote file `foo.txt` into local file `/tmp/foo.txt` with
# explicit file:// scheme set
$ neuro cp storage:foo.txt file:///tmp/foo.txt
$ neuro cp -T storage:foo.txt file:///tmp/foo.txt
$ neuro cp storage:foo.txt file:///tmp
$ neuro cp storage:foo.txt -t file:///tmp

# download other user's remote file into the current directory
$ neuro cp storage://{username}/foo.txt .

# download only files with extension `.out` into the current directory
$ neuro cp storage:results/*.out .
```

```

List contents of directories in a tree-like format.

Tree is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth indented listing of files, which is colorized ala dircolors if the LS\_`COLORS` environment variable is set and output is to tty. With no arguments, tree lists the files in the storage: directory. When directory arguments are given, tree lists all the files and/or directories found in the given directories each in turn. Upon completion of listing all files/directories found, tree returns the total number of files and/or directories listed.

By default `PATH` is equal user's home dir \(storage:\)
