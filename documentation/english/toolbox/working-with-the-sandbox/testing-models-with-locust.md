# Testing Models with Locust

[Locust](https://locust.io/) is an open-source load testing tool. You can use it in conjunction with platform to test your models and make sure they work as expected before deploying them to production.

## Using Locust with the platform

### Prerequisites

Before testing the model with Locust, you will need to make a test deployment via MLflow. To do this, you will need to run the following command:

```
$ apolo-flow run deploy_inference_platform --param run_id <run-id>
```

You can check the required run ID in MLflow:

By running the `deploy_inference_platform` job, you gain access to the target model's binary and deploy it to the platform cluster.

Once the job is running, it will also generate a predictable URI which you can later use to access the model in Locust.

### Running Locust

You can specify how the platform will use Locust via the `.neuro/live.yml` file in the project's root folder.

In the `jobs` section of the `live.yml` file, you will find a default `locust` job description that looks like this:

```yaml
locust:
    image: locustio/locust:1.4.1
    name: $[[ flow.title ]]-locust
    http_port: 8080
    http_auth: False
    life_span: 1d
    detach: True
    browse: True
    params:
      endpoint_url: 
        default: ~
        descr: |
          Examples:
          https://demo-oss-dogs-test-inference--<user-name>.jobs.<cluster-name>.org.neu.ro/api/v1.0/predictions - if model deployed as platform job
          http://seldon.<cluster-name>.org.neu.ro/seldon/seldon/<model-name>-<model-stage>/api/v1.0/predictions -if model is deployed in Seldon
    volumes:
      - $[[ upload(volumes.src).ref_ro ]]
      - $[[ upload(volumes.config).ref_ro ]]
      - $[[ volumes.remote_dataset.ref_ro ]]
    env:
      DOG_IDS: "n02085936, n02088094"
      IMGS_DIR: $[[ volumes.remote_dataset.mount ]]/images/Images/
      PYTHONPATH: $[[ volumes.src.mount ]]/..
    cmd: |
      -f $[[ volumes.src.mount ]]/locust.py --web-port 8080 -H $[[ params.endpoint_url ]]
```

You can always fine-tune the job depending on your needs by changing the values of various parameters such as `http_port` or `life_span` in the description.

To run a `locust` job, execute the following:

```
$ apolo-flow run locust
```

This job will use a `locust.py` file specified in the `cmd` section of the job definition. This file will tell Locust what specific tests to run and how to run them. You can [learn more about writing Locust files here](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/writing-a-locustfile.html).

Once the Locust job is up and running, you will need to open Locust in your browser by using the predictable URI generated in the previous steps.&#x20;

Next, enter the locust URL of the job on the platform in the **Host** field and click **Start swarming**:

When this is done, you can modify the amount of simulated users and the spawn rate and monitor the testing process through various charts:
