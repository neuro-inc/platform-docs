# Running Elastic Horovod Training

[Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod) is a distributed deep learning training framework that helps make the learning process faster and easier.

Horovod is great when it comes to running training in a job on preemptible or spot instances, as there's a dedicated elastic mode for cases like this. Elastic training enables Horovod to scale the number of workers up and down dynamically at runtime.

## Running Horovod with TensorFlow

We created a script for running Horovod with TensorFlow based on the official [TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner) and extended it with the help of this [Horovod tutorial](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/elastic.html).

Here's how you can use it with Apolo.

### Preparation

You can clone the [repository containing this script](https://github.com/neuro-inc/mlops-horovod-example) by running:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/neuro-inc/mlops-horovod-example.git
```

Once it's cloned, switch to its local root folder:

```
$ cd <local-repo-path>
```

Then, generate a SSH key to allow SSH-based communication between jobs:

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ssh-keys/id_rsa -q -N ""
```

Now, store the private part of the SSH key. It will be used by the main node to coordinate secondary nodes:

```
$ apolo secret add horovod-id-rsa @ssh-keys/id_rsa
```

Store the public part of the SSH key which will be used by the secondary nodes to validate the main node:

```
$ apolo secret add horovod-id-rsa-pub @ssh-keys/id_rsa.pub
```

### Launching the main training node

To run the main training node, execute the following command:

```
$ apolo-flow run main
```

This job will additionally wait for 600 seconds for the secondary nodes to appear (see "--start-timeout 600" in the `main` job's `bash` section).

### Launching secondary nodes

Execute this command a few times to spawn worker nodes:

```
$ apolo-flow run secondary
```

For this example, at least two workers are needed (see "--num-proc 2" in the `main` job's `bash` description). All of these worker nodes will be connected to the Horovod instance.&#x20;

You could also update the number of secondary nodes during the training process. Each of them will be connected and synchronized with the main training process - this is the main feature of Horovod in elastic mode.
