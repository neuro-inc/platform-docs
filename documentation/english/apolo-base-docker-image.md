## Usage

You can utilize our docker image in various ways, pulling it from public repository, using it locally or in Apolo jobs.

**Base path**

```
ghcr.io/neuro-inc/base
```

**Non-versioned tags**

```
latest-runtime-minimal
latest
latest-runtime
latest-devel
latest-devel-minimal
```

**Apolo-flow**

when you are creating Apolo flow using our template, by default we expose base Docker

{% embed url="https://github.com/neuro-inc/flow-template" %}
Apolo flow repo
{% endembed %}

{% embed url="https://github.com/neuro-inc/flow-template-barebone" %}
Apolo flow barebone
{% endembed %}

Also, if you don't want to edit the Dockerfile, you can specify docker directly in your job .neuro/live.yml

```
......... .neuro/live.yml

kind: live
title: My flow
defaults:
   .......
jobs:
  job:
    args:
      image: ghcr.io/neuro-inc/base:latest
```

## Conda environments

By default, our Docker image provides three Conda environments:

*   **Default**: Automatically activated through the `.bashrc` configuration for all terminal sessions

    can be activated using

    <pre><code><strong>conda activate base 
    </strong>OR
    <strong>source /opt/conda/bin/activate base
    </strong></code></pre>
*   **TensorFlow-specific**: Optimized for TensorFlow workflows.\
    can be activated using

    <pre><code><strong>conda activate tf 
    </strong>OR
    <strong>source /opt/conda/bin/activate tf
    </strong></code></pre>
*   **Torch-specific**: Tailored for PyTorch operations.

    can be activated using

    <pre><code><strong>conda activate torch 
    </strong>OR
    <strong>source /opt/conda/bin/activate torch
    </strong></code></pre>

**Environment**

We strive to keep dependencies up-to-date. If you require a more recent version or believe an update could enhance the platform, please reach out to us. Alternatively, you can extend our base Dockerfile to install any additional dependencies you need.

```
FROM ghcr.io/neuro-inc/base:v24.12.0-runtime
RUN pip install ...
```
