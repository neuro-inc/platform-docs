# Clusters

Clusters are collections of resources - compute, storage, and the registry. When you sign-up on Apolo, you could ask someone that have respective access level to add you to their organization. This provides access to clusters the organization has access to.&#x20;

Under the hood, cluster is a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster being managed by Apolo services.

You can also create new clusters, but this requires additional access. For more information, contact [support@apolo.us](mailto:support@apolo.us).

You can use one cluster at a time and switch between clusters. This tutorial will helps you understand how you can manage resources.

### **How can I manage my clusters?**

Each cluster comes with its own storage, registry, resource presets and other services.&#x20;

You can view information about your current cluster both in the CLI and in the Apolo Console:&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CLI" %}
You can use the `apolo config show` command to view the current cluster's name, API URL, docker registry URL, and the list of presets available for this cluster.

```
$ apolo config show

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Apolo Console" %}

To view information about your current cluster in the Apolo Console, look at the top right corner of the screen. You will see a section labeled "Cluster" with the name of your current cluster (e.g., "default"). Clicking on the dropdown arrow next to the cluster name will provide more details about the current cluster.

### **How can I view all my clusters and switch my current cluster?**

You can view the list of available clusters and switch between them both in the CLI and in the Apolo Console:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CLI" %}
You can use the `apolo config get-clusters` command to view the list of clusters that you have access to and information about them.

```
$ apolo config get-clusters
Fetch the list of available clusters...
Available clusters:
* Name: neuro-public
  Presets:

    cpu-small       1    2.0G       No
    cpu-large       7   28.0G       No

    cpu-large     4   10.0G       No                                   
    gpu-small    23   60.0G       No      1 x nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080ti
    gpu-large    46  120.0G       No      2 x nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080ti
```

You can switch between clusters by using the `apolo config switch-cluster` command. When you run the command, you are prompted to enter the name of the cluster you want to switch to. The current cluster is switched after you provide the name.

```
$ apolo config switch-cluster

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Apolo Console" %}
To view all your clusters and switch the current one, click on the dropdown arrow next to the cluster name in the top right corner. A menu will appear with all available clusters. Select the desired one to switch.

### **How can I view my credits?**

Usually, you are assigned a computation quota in term of credits. Those credits are consumed whenever you run a job. Credits are cluster-bound which means, you have different balances in different clusters.

You can view the remaining credits on your Apolo Console dashboard. The `apolo config show` command also shows the amount of credits left as part of its output too.

### How can I request for more credits?

You can top up your credits by clicking the **Credits** menu on the Apolo Console dashboard.

You can also contact [support@apolo.us](mailto:support@apolo.us) or corresponding cluster provider to learn about latest discounts and promotions, and then request the top up.

### How can I create a new cluster?&#x20;

Apolo lets you create new clusters for better management and orchestration of resources. Before you create a cluster, you must decide on the presets, storage, and registry that you want to assign for this cluster. You can create a cluster by writing to us at  [support@apolo.us](mailto:support@apolo.us).
