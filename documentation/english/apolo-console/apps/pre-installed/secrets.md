# Secrets

The Secrets app in the Apolo Console allows users to securely store and manage sensitive data, such as API tokens, passwords, and configuration values, associated with their projects. Secrets ensure that sensitive information remains protected while being accessible to authorized applications and services.

The Secrets app, accessible from the left-hand navigation menu, provides a centralized interface to:

- Create and manage secure key-value pairs.
- View a list of existing secrets.
- Delete secrets that are no longer required.
