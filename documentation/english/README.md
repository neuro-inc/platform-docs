# Introduction

## The basics

[Apolo](https://apolo.us) is a flexible and robust machine learning platform. 

<!--

It consists of two parts:

* **Apolo Core** is a resource orchestrator. It can be installed in a cloud or on-premise and combines computation capabilities, storage, and environments (Docker images) in one system with single sign-on authentication (SSO) and advanced permission management system. This frees teams working with Apolo from DevOps boilerplate tasks.
* **Apolo Toolbox** is a toolset integrator. It contains integrations with various open-source and commercial tools required for modern ML/AI development. This addresses the majority of MLOps issues a team may have.

-->

If you're new to Apolo, here are two simple steps to get started:

* [Sign up](https://console.apolo.us) and contact [start@apolo.us](mailto:start@apolo.us) for potential collaboration or free trial.&#x20;
* Follow our [Getting Started](first-steps/getting-started.md) guide.

## Digging deeper

For detailed information on specific use cases, feel free to refer to our ML development guides. For example:

* [Experiment tracking with Weights and Biases](toolbox/experiment-tracking/experiment-tracking-with-weights-and-biases.md)
* [Remote debugging with PyCharm Professional](toolbox/remote-debugging/remote-debugging-with-pycharm-professional.md)

Also, take a look at our [CLI reference](https://neu-ro.gitbook.io/neu-ro-cli-reference/) and [Python API reference](https://neuro-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
