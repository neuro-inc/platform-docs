# Images

## Overview

The Images app provides a central location for viewing properties of container image assets used in deployments.

The Images application is accessible from the left-side navigation menu in the Apolo Console. All container images associated with the selected project and cluster, along with detailed information about each image. Each image is represented by a path.

A search field at the top of the list allows you to quickly locate specific images by name or path.

On the right side of the screen, selecting an image displays detailed information about it, including:

* _Image Tags_. Tags associated with the image. Useful for version control (e.g., latest).
* _Image Path_. The full path to the image within the Apolo storage.
* _Creation Date_. The date when the image was added.
* _Size_. Total size of the image.
* _Copy Icons_. Allows the user to copy either the image path or tag to the clipboard for easy reference.
